Huffman exercise

JianPing Tang

huffman compression is a compression method, you could add a file to 'source file' and compress it after you press 'compress' button. You could decompress a file by adding a file to the 'compressed file' and press the 'decompress ' button.

the source folder contains source code. I use open source DirectUI frame(duilib) as skin.
